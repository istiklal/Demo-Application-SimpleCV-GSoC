All the works for GSoC SimpleCV are here.

In demo1.py I used the SimpleCV library extensively.

In demo2.py I edit the function in SimpleCV, findKeypointsMatch and used it. It yielded good results. Now the images fit without 
editing anything. I just changed something in the findKeypointMatch function. The color is still a problem in the SimpleCV
library. Need to look at it.

Thank You.
