All the works for GSoC SimpleCV are here.

In demo1.py I used the SimpleCV library extensively.

In demo2.py now the images fit without having to do manually anything. I just changed something in the findKeypointMatch function.
The color is still a problem in the SimpleCV library though which is why the images look different. Need to look at it.

Thank You.
